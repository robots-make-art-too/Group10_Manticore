6.Python Indentation:
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

7.Python Variables:
x = 1, y = str, no need for 'int' and 'String', but could also be specified by adding int() or str().
So x = int(1) is different from x = str(1), the outprint value will be x = 1 and x = '1'

8.Python Variables:
Unpacking a collection:
fruits = ["Banana, Apple, Pineapple"]
x = y = z = fruits
Print(x,y,z)
Banana
Apple
Pineapple

9.Python Variables:
Global Variabrls:
x = 'awesome'

def myfun()
  x = 'fantastic'
  print("Python is" + x)
  
mufun()

print("Python is" + x)

The result will be:
Python is fantastic
Python is awesome
