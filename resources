6.Python Indentation:
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

7.Python Variables:
x = 1, y = str, no need for 'int' and 'String', but could also be specified by adding int() or str().
So x = int(1) is different from x = str(1), the outprint value will be x = 1 and x = '1'
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp

8.Python Variables:
Unpacking a collection:
fruits = ["Banana, Apple, Pineapple"]
x = y = z = fruits
Print(x,y,z)
Banana
Apple
Pineapple

9.Python Variables:
Global Variabrls:
x = 'awesome'

def myfun()
  x = 'fantastic'
  print("Python is" + x)
  
mufun()

print("Python is" + x)

The result will be:
Python is fantastic
Python is awesome

10.Python number type:
int, float and complex.
x = int(2.8)
y = float(1)
z = complex(x)

print(x,y,z)

result:
2
1.0
1 + 0j

 6. Python Classes/Objects:

- Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

- here is an example: 

class Person:

  def __init__(self, name, age):

    self.name = name

    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Bella", 21)

print(p1.name)

print(p1.age)
