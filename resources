6.Python Indentation:
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

7.Python Variables:
x = 1, y = str, no need for 'int' and 'String', but could also be specified by adding int() or str().
So x = int(1) is different from x = str(1), the outprint value will be x = 1 and x = '1'
