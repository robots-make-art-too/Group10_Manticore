 6. Python Classes/Objects:

- Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

- here is an example: 

class Person:

  def __init__(self, name, age):

    self.name = name

    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Bella", 21)

print(p1.name)

print(p1.age)
